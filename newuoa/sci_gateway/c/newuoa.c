/*     This subroutine seeks the least value of a function of many variables, */
/*     by a trust region method that forms quadratic models by interpolation. */
/*     There can be some freedom in the interpolation conditions, which is */
/*     taken up by minimizing the Frobenius norm of the change to the second */
/*     derivative of the quadratic model, beginning with a zero matrix. The */
/*     arguments of the subroutine are as follows. */

/*     N must be set to the number of variables and must be at least two. */
/*     NPT is the number of interpolation conditions. Its value must be in the */
/*       interval [N+2,(N+1)(N+2)/2]. */
/*     Initial values of the variables must be set in X(1),X(2),...,X(N). They */
/*       will be changed to the values that give the least calculated F. */
/*     RHOBEG and RHOEND must be set to the initial and final values of a trust */
/*       region radius, so both must be positive with RHOEND<=RHOBEG. Typically */
/*       RHOBEG should be about one tenth of the greatest expected change to a */
/*       variable, and RHOEND should indicate the accuracy that is required in */
/*       the final values of the variables. */
/*     The value of IPRINT should be set to 0, 1, 2 or 3, which controls the */
/*       amount of printing. Specifically, there is no output if IPRINT=0 and */
/*       there is output only at the return if IPRINT=1. Otherwise, each new */
/*       value of RHO is printed, with the best vector of variables so far and */
/*       the corresponding value of the objective function. Further, each new */
/*       value of F with its variables are output if IPRINT=3. */
/*     MAXFUN must be set to an upper bound on the number of calls of CALFUN. */
/*     The array W will be used for working space. Its length must be at least */
/*     (NPT+13)*(NPT+N)+3*N*(N+3)/2. */
