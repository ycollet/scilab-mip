   * The evaluate function which is called by OBOE.
   * At every iteration, i.e. call to QpGenerator::run() function,
   * OBOE asks the Oracle to provide it with the cut information
   * at the current query point y.
   * 
   * For a given query point, y, the eval function should return the following:
   *
   * @return functionValue which is an vector of size NumCuts x 1
   *    This value represents the following:
   *
   *    For the non-smooth function f1(.) :
   *    For optimality cuts, i.e *info = 1, functionValue is typically the
   *    function evaluation at the current query point, y.
   *    For feasiblity cuts, i.e *info = 0, however, this is a value which 
   *    would make the cut described by the subGradients matrix valid in the 
   *    form :
   *    functionValue + subGradients^T*(y' - y) <= 0, for all feasible points y'
   *
   *    For the smooth function f2(.) :
   *    It again represents the function value f2(y). 
   *
   * @return Sub-gradient at y in matrix subGradients which of size
   *    NumVariables x NumCuts. 
   *    The user can provide more than one cut for each query point, which
   *    usually is required when the NumSubProblems is more than 1.
   *
   *    The subgradient vector(with abuse of name) is also used to
   *    provide a valid cuts incase the given point, y, is not feasible.
   *    Hence the eval function is responsible for providing both optimality
   *    and feasibility cuts.
   *
   * @return AccpmGenMatrix *info:
   *    For non-smooth function f1 it is a vector of dimension NumCuts x 1.
   *    It specifies the cut type for each cut:
   *    (i) For feasibility cut,   *info(i,0) = 0 
   *    (ii) For optimality cut i, *info(i,0) = i, the index of subproblem.
   *    
   *	For the smooth function f2, this vector has the Hessian information. 
   *    It is a vector of dimension NumVariables x NumVariables 
   *    (if parameter diagHessian is false) otherwise its
   *	has dimension NumVariables x 1
   * 
   *	The return value is 0 on success and 1 to terminate the Outer Iterations
   *    and hence the Query point generation process.
   *
   *    Note: The number of cuts, NumCuts, returned at every iteration is 
   *    controlled by the user by providing the vectors and matrices of 
   * 	corresponding size.
