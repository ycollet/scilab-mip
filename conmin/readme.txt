The CONMIN optimization method is currently used in NASTRAN (a professionnal
finite element tool) and the optimization part of NASTRAN (the CONMIN tool) is
currently public domain.
The CONMIN fortran program has been written by G. Vanderplaats.
This optimization method can solve efficiently constrained optimization
problems.
This interface works under windows / linux.
