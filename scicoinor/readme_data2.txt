SciCoinOR Data2 Toolbox

With this installation, a lot of .mps files are shipped. These files come from various test set libraries. A MPS file is a format dedicated to handle mixed integer linear programs.

These data are installed in the demos/data2. A description of these files is available in the demos/listoffiles.html file.
