AMPL Toolbox

This toolbox allows you to use the .nl files from the AMPL tool under scilab.
.nl files are compiled files obtained from .mod files. These files describe mathematically optimization problems.

To use this toolbox under scilab: go into the ampl toolbox installation directory and do a:

exec loader.sce;

Once the toolbox has been loaded, close and reopen the help browser to access to the documentation of the functions.
You have also access to a demo via the ?->Demonstrations of Scilab button from the GUI.

In the demos directory, there is also a ipopt_optim.sce demos. To launch such a demo, download and install the scicoinor toolbox before.
In the demos/data, a set of .nl files are shipped. A description of these files is available in the demos/listoffiles.html file.
