DoE: a toolbox to help compute design of experiments

Todo :
- a select_table / get_table function
- doe_opti_ssd (optimization of a nxn experiment matrix, order lines by increasing criterion, order columns by increasing correlation)
- an alias generator
- a function which lists the monomes of a model, remove a monome, add a monome
- a function which allows to identify a linear model
- change yates and ryates names
- create a thirdparty directory and put fliplr and flipud
